🛡️Cyber Security Internship – Task 1
Understanding Cyber Security Basics & Attack Surface

## Overview
This repository contains Task 1 completed as part of the Cyber Security Internship program.  
The task focuses on building a strong foundation in cyber security concepts such as the CIA Triad, types of cyber attackers, attack surfaces, and awareness of common vulnerabilities.

## Objective
The main objectives of this task are:
- To understand the basics of cyber security
- To learn the CIA Triad with real-world examples
- To identify common types of cyber attackers
- To understand attack surfaces in modern applications
- To gain awareness of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- To analyze data flow and identify possible attack points

## Task Summary
In this task, I studied core cyber security concepts through self-research and documentation.  
I analyzed commonly used applications such as email, messaging apps, and banking applications to understand how data flows from user to server and where attacks can occur.  
I also reviewed the OWASP Top 10 to understand why common vulnerabilities are dangerous.
