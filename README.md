🛡️ Cyber Security Internship – Task 1
Understanding Cyber Security Basics & Attack Surface

📌 Overview
This repository contains Task 1 completed as part of the Cyber Security Internship program.
The main objective of this task is to build a strong foundational understanding of cyber security concepts, identify attack surfaces, and develop awareness about common cyber threats and vulnerabilities faced by modern digital systems.
This task focuses on conceptual clarity, self-research ability, and security awareness, which are essential skills for any cyber security professional.


🎯 Objective of the Task
The key objectives of this task are:
To understand the core principles of cyber security using the CIA Triad
To identify different types of cyber attackers and their motivations
To understand what an attack surface is and why it is important
To study the OWASP Top 10 and its relevance in web application security
To analyze real-world applications and map them to possible attack surfaces
To understand data flow in applications and identify possible attack points
To prepare interview-ready explanations of basic cyber security concepts
